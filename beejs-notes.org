#+TITLE: Beejs Notes

* Chapter One

*Compiling for this book*

~gcc -std=c99 -pedantic foo.c~

C Preprocessor

Anything that starts with an octothorpe is something the preprocessor operates on before the compiler, common /directives/ ~#include~ ~#define~

one way function calls can be indicated is by a lack of squirelly braces after them

sequences that start with ~%~ tell ~printf~ what to print. %s - string %f - float %d int etc



* Chapter 3 Variables & Statements

any characters in the range of 0-9, A-Z, a-z and underscores
*Cannot start with*
- a digit (0-9)
- 2 underscores
- an underscore followed by a capital A-Z

#+begin_src C
int main(void) {
  int i = 2;
  float f = 3.14;
  char *s = "Hello, this is a string";

  printf("%s i = %d and f = %f!\n", s, i, f);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| Hello | this is a string i = 2 and f = 3.140000! |

** 3.2 Operators and Expressions

~sizeof~ operator

~%zu~ is format specifier for ~size_t~ (t is for type, pronounced "size tee")

~printf("%zu", sizeof a); //prints 4 on my system~

~printf("%zu", sizeof(2 + 7)); //prints 4 on my system~

~printf("%zu", sizeof 3.14); //prints 8 on my system~

it is the size in bytes of th /type/ of the expression itself, thats why 2+7 is the same as size a, they are both an ~int~

** 3.2.3 Ternary Operator

an expression whose value depends on the result of a conditional embedded in it

~y += x > 10? 17: 37;~

is equivalent to this non expression:

#+begin_src C
if (x > 10)
    y += 17;
else
    y += 37;
#+end_src

or an example that prints if a number stored in x is odd or even:

~printf("The number %d is %s.\n", x, x % 2, == 0?"even": "odd")~

** 3.2.4 Pre and Post Increment and Decrement
