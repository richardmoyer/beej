C Preprocessor

Anything that starts with an octothorpe is something the preprocessor operates on before the compiler, common /directives/ ~#include~ ~#define~

one way function calls can be indicated is by a lack of squirelly braces after them

sequences that start with ~%~ tell ~printf~ what to print. %s - string %f - float %d int etc

#+begin_src C
int main(void) {
  int i = 2;
  float f = 3.14;
  char *s = "Hello, this is a string";

  printf("%s i = %d and f = %f!\n", s, i, f);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| Hello | this is a string i = 2 and f = 3.140000! |
